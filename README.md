- #### **Back-end**
    * **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)** - a lightweight micro web framework written in Python used to create a simple,
        clean code and to reduce development time.
    * **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/2)** - non-relational database, used to store, manipulate and retrieve data.
    * **[Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/)** - used with Flask to securely store passwords with salted hashes and verify
        user passwords to authenticate users.
    * **[Flask Jinja](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/templating/)** - used as it's a part of a Flask package and to allow template inheritance.

    * **Git** - used to keep track of the changes made to the repository and for version control.
    * **Gitpod** - I used CI full template as an IDE to develop, commit and push files to GitHub. 
    * **GitHub** - used as a hosting service and for future collaborations.
    * **Heroku** - my GitHub repo for this project had been connected to Heroku app to enable management and deployment of this app.

## Testing

The testing data for this project can be found in a separate file called [here](https://github.com/murthy1811/Milestone-Project-3-AirBubble/blob/master/TESTING.md).

### Issues and Solutions
* travel story cards on small screens overlapped due to no media queries intially. CSS is fixed later
* No defensive deletion confirmation added for admin user due to lack of time, but also intended admin user uses due diligence before deleting 
* While Code validations, found defensive deletion missing for session user in read more page. Fixed later by adding modal
* Form input for origin_country is not taking spaces intially but later fixed by adjusting pattern attribute
* While python code is checked for PEP8 requirements, indentation went wrong and edit-story page did not functioned. Indentation fixed later.
* Edit story page cancel button takes you to home page instead of profile page. Fixed by adjusting the jinja code url.
* Logged user can delete their comments and feature is not added due to time constraint. Only Admin can delete the comments

## Deployment

- #### **Requirements:**
    * **Python3** to write the code and run the application
    * **PIP** to install packages
    * **Git** for version control
    * **GitPod** powered by VS Code was used for this project (any IDE of your choice will work)
    * **MongoDB** - to create and manipulate the database
    * **Heroku** - to deploy and manage the app


### Project Creation

* This project was created using the CI recommended [Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
* Click on **_Use this template_** button and enter a short and memorable name of your choice for your repo and select **_Create repository from template_**. 
* Once created, click on green **_Gitpod_** button to open your new workspace. 

### Deployment to Heroku
Heroku cloud platform was used to deploy and host this app by following the steps below:

* **Set up workspace for Heroku:** 
    * In the terminal window of your IDE, create a requirements.txt file to contain all applications and dependencies required to run the app.

        ``` pip3 freeze --local . requirements.txt```
    * Create a Procfile (always with a capital P and no file extension!) - required by Heroku, to know which file runs the app.

        ``` echo web: python app.py > Procfile```

* **Create application in Heroku:**
    * Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) website and create an account.
    * Once logged in, click on the **_New_** button and select **_Create New App_**
    * Create a name for your app and select the region closest to your location.

* **Connect your app to GitHub repository:**
    * On the **_Deploy_** page, select GitHub as your **_Deplyment method_**.
    * You will then be prompted to find the github repository, click on **_Connect_** button to connect.
    * Click on the **_Settings_** tab and and select **_Config Vars_** and **_Reveal Config Vars_**.
    * Add the following variables (as stored in env.py):

    ```
    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "paste_your_secret_key_from_env.py")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "obtained_from_your MongoDB_account")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "your_db_name")
    ```
    * In the IDE terminal, push the two new files to the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git add requirements.txt
    git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"        
    ```
    ``` 
    git add Procfile
    git commit -m "Add Procfile"
    git push
    ```
* Now go back to Heroku and click on **_Enable Automatic Deployment_** and **_Deploy Branch_**.
* The app is now connected and Heroku will receive the code from GitHub and automatically update whenever we push changes to the GitHub repository. You should be able to see "Your app was successfully deployed!". Click on **_View_** to launch your app.


### Clone the project
Steps required to **_Clone_** a repository from GitHub to your local machine:
* Navigate to the repository in GitHub.
* Click on the **_Code_** dropdown menu button.
* Click on **_Open with GitHub Desktop_** and follow the prompts to complete the cloning process.

### Fork the project
* To create a personal copy of this repository, click on **_Fork_** button on the top right corner of the repository page in GitHub.


### Run Locally
To run this project on your device using the IDE of your choice follow these steps:
* Install the requirements by typing in your IDE: 

    ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
* Navigate to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
    * Create an account and sign in. 
    * Click on **_Create New Cluster_** and then **_+ Create Database_** to create a database.
    * Create **category**, **travel_stories**, **user_profile** and **user_comments** collections in the database as shown below:

    **_category_**
    ```
    _id: <ObjectId>
    category_name:<string>
    ```
    **_travel_stories_**
    ```
    _id: <ObjectId>
    category_name:<string>
    origin:<string>
    origin_country:<string>
    transit:<string>
    transit_country:<string>
    destination:<string>
    destination_country:<string>
    date_of_journey:<int>
    no_of_adults:<int>
    kids_under_12:<int>
    kids_under_6:<int>
    covid_report:<array>
    your_experience:<string>
    added_by:<string>
    ```
    **_user_profile_**
    ```
    _id: <ObjectId>
    emailaddress:<string>
    username:<string & Int>
    password:<string & Int>
    ```

    **_user_comments_**
    ```
    _id: <ObjectId>
    comment:<string>
    linked_travel_id:<travel_stories.ObjectId>
    
    ```

* In your IDE terminal, create the environment variables:   
    * Type ```touch env.py``` 
    in the terminal to create the file in the root directory. This file is used to store sensitive data (see environment variables above) and should never be pushed to GitHub.
    * To ignore it, create .gitignore file by typing 

    ```touch .gitignore``` 

    and add env.py into this file.
* You can now run the app, just type in the IDE terminal: 

    ```python3 app.py```.
